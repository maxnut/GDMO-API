# GDMO API

This simple project illustrates a simple example of the GDMO API

You can use this API to make extensions similar to MHV7

The download link is in the [releases](https://github.com/maxnut/GDMO-API/releases/latest)

## Usage

To use this API it is expected to know how to setup a basic c++ project and write some code.

You will find a GDMenu.lib file and an API.h file in the download;

Add the library file to your project libraries, and simply drag the API.h file like it was any other header file.

You should now be able to use the api; see the example project above for simple usage.

Once you've compiled your dll, simply drag it into GDMenu/dll.
